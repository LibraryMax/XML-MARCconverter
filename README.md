XML-MARCconverter
=================

This is a simple PERL converter to turn a basic XML output into an XMLMARC file for upload to a repository/ILS of your choice.
It was originally created to work with the Mendeley reference tool's output, and the INVENIO integrated library system's input. (Bibupload)
